#  BJT Circuit Design Project

## Overview
This project involves designing a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) circuit. It includes calculations, circuit simulations, and analysis of input-output waveforms.

## Files Included
- **Circuit Simulation (.tsc file)** – Includes the designed BJT circuit.
- **Calculation PDF** – Detailed calculations and analysis.
- **Circuit Diagram** – A visual representation of the BJT circuit.
- **Waveform Images** – Input and output waveforms for performance analysis.

## How to Use
1. Open the `.tsc` file in the appropriate simulation software.
2. Review the calculations in the PDF.
3. Analyze the circuit diagram and waveforms for insights.
